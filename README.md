# Advent Of Code - My Solutions 
**Author**: Janahan Selvanayagam 

I have recently (2018) started these [programming puzzles](adventofcode.com) that I found quite interesting. I will be uploading 2018 solutions as regularly as I can. Previous years will come soon!

I use Python 3 for my solutions and generally stick to builtin packages and `numpy` (though I have on occasion used other packages such as `pandas` and `networkx`)

Pardon my somewhat hastily written code!
